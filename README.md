<The Place Where We Live>
 I built a mini natural world in Three.js, a creative work about the natural environmental issues that humans live in. It is presented through artistic visual animation on the web side to make the work more expressive and immersive for the viewer.

  #**CODE**  
  I used a variety of Math and noise randomly generated three-dimensional forms together to form a moving natural world, with abstract forms such as coral, sand and gravel, ocean, water, clouds, etc., presented as a whole inside and outside the sphere. Each opening generates a different form.
  
  Examples:

   #**TEXTURE**  
  The use of texture and light on the generated forms for atmospheric rendering gives the whole piece a vaguely broken and blurred texture, but at the same time it is a beautiful visual representation.

   #**INTERACTION**  
  In terms of interaction, I set up mouse clicks, scaling up and down interactions to allow participants to easily explore the natural environment in which we live in 
the work. The 360-degree view allows participants to explore the whole earth like form from both macro and micro perspectives, triggering an awareness of the natural environment we live in, perhaps in terms of environmental protection or the beauty of nature.
  
   #**LIGHT**  
  In the light, I used red and purple lighting, combined with the marine blue of the material, the special texture of the material mapping the light also creates a new visual experience at the same time, creating a mysterious atmosphere.
  
   #**OTHERS**  
  The music and fonts added to the web page also cater to the mysterious atmosphere of the image and make it more immersive for the participants.
